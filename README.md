# VCFtoGWAS <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />
This package was built to assist in opening VCF files in R (based on the [vcfR](https://knausb.github.io/vcfR_documentation/) package) and then processing the data to get a GWAS matrix and execute the GWAS and analyze the results. 
It was not built as a wide tool to assist everyone but rather be a usefull tool for a specific dataset. Though it can be used for other datasets, more work and/or thought might be needed.
