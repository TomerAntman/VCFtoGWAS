# Motivation

### *GWAS*

The aim of Genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) is to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of which the allele frequencies vary systematically as a function of phenotypic trait values.  

Identification of trait‐associated SNPs may subsequently reveal new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying these phenotypes. 

The main package used here for GWAS is "statgenGWAS" 


### *VCF* 

VCF files are big genetic files and working with them might be complicated. 


The main package used here for loading the vcf file is "vcfR"
